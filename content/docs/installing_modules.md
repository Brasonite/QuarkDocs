As of the time of writing, Quark isn't available to download in the Godot Asset Library. Instead, modules must be downloaded individually from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Brasonite/Quark).

Installing a Quark module is often as easy as adding the module's script anywhere in the Godot project. Sometimes, however, a script will have extra installation steps associated with it. In these cases, these steps will be detailed both in the script and on its page in this website.

An example of an extra installation step is adding the module as an autoload.
