The **Quark Collection** is a library of single-file utilities built for use in Godot 4.

This project aims to create the simplest possible reusable modules for game development while also keeping the flexibility and power of more complex solutions.

## Origin

While working with Godot, I found many addons contain a lot of unnecessary clutter, with an installation process that leaves a lot to be desired. Not only that, but they often do things in a way that is, in my opinion, over-engineered, which is terrible for game jams.

As such, taking heavy inspiration from STB, I created Quark as a way to have reusable code without relying on addons or unnecessary complexity.
